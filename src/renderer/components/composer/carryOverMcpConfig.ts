/**
 * The per-thread MCP servers a handoff carries into the target provider.
 *
 * A switch continues the same task, so every server the user turned on for it
 * comes along. The launch path gates each one on its thread-config flag alone
 * (`resolve*McpForLaunch` reads `config.browserMcp`, `config.chromeMcp`, …), so
 * a flag is worth carrying to any provider — including one whose `mcpScope` is
 * "none". That scope only says the provider's composer offers no toggle; the
 * server still starts and the agent still gets it.
 * Explicit per-thread opt-outs also follow the task so plugin defaults cannot
 * silently turn a tool back on when the provider changes.
 *
 * Two things genuinely cannot honor a carried flag, and only those are dropped:
 *
 * - a provider that owns its MCP config on its settings page
 *   (`mcpConfigSource: "agentSettings"`), where per-thread flags are replaced by
 *   that provider's settings at launch;
 * - a server the *project* cannot reach — Chrome and Computer Use in a WSL
 *   project. The launch resolvers drop those anyway; carrying them would only
 *   leave a chip for a server that never runs.
 *
 * Custom (user and project) MCP servers are not per-thread config: they are
 * resolved from settings at launch, so they follow the thread on their own.
