# Poracode

Universal AI agent orchestrator — Electron desktop app managing Claude, Codex, and Gemini via real PTY sessions (terminal-native) and structured runtimes (native chat).

## Required workflow

- **Before making changes, read [docs/FORK_WORKFLOW.md](docs/FORK_WORKFLOW.md) and [.github/CONTRIBUTING.md](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md), including its Pull request flow.** This is required in every new task/session; do not assume the documents were read in a previous chat. The fork workflow defines the worktree, PR target, CI, merge, and release rules for this repository.
- **Deliver changes through a pull request unless the user explicitly requests otherwise.** Work on a dedicated branch, run the required checks, commit and push the task's changes, then open a PR against `master` in the intended repository. For fork work, confirm the target from the configured remotes and task context; do not default to the upstream project.
- Include the PR link and validation results in the final response. Local edits or a successful build alone do not complete an implementation task. If publication is blocked, report the exact blocker and the remaining steps; do not claim the task is complete.

## Quick Reference

- **Package manager:** `pnpm` (12.3.4, pinned in `package.json#packageManager`)
- **Node:** >= 24.10.0
- **Typecheck:** `pnpm run typecheck` (tsc, TypeScript 7 native)
- **Lint:** `pnpm run lint` (oxlint)
- **Format:** `pnpm run fmt` (oxfmt) / `pnpm run fmt:check`
- **Test:** `pnpm run test` (vitest)
- **Dev:** `pnpm run dev`
- **Build:** `pnpm run build` then `pnpm run dist`

## Critical Rules

- Terminal-presentation threads must be backed by a real PTY process; GUI-presentation threads must be backed by the provider structured runtime process. The active presentation surface is the source of truth.
- The renderer must never spawn agent processes — the supervisor runtime owns all agent processes.
- React Compiler is the default memoization strategy. Do not add `useMemo`, `useCallback`, or `React.memo` unless escaping the compiler. Keep `babel-plugin-react-compiler` pinned to an exact version.
- Use HeroUI v3 for all non-terminal UI. When working with HeroUI components, always load the `heroui-react` skill first (`/skill heroui-react`).
- **Every user-facing string you add or change in `src/renderer` must be localized.** Wrap it in a Lingui macro, run `pnpm i18n:extract`, then fill the new `msgstr` in all 12 non-English catalogs — never ship empty translations (that leaves a half-English UI). See [Internationalization (i18n)](#internationalization-i18n).
- **The codebase is provider-agnostic — declare behavior, never branch on it.** Providers are self-contained plugins (supervisor adapter + renderer UI). Shared runtime, UI, and layout code must contain no provider name, no `kind === "<provider>"` branch, and no constant, regex, parser, or state field that exists to serve one agent. When one provider needs different behavior, add a _named, documented_ option to the shared module and declare its value in the provider folder — the shared side must read as a capability, not as a vendor workaround. Vendor payload formats are parsed behind a provider-supplied hook that owns its own state. Tests follow the code: a test named after a provider belongs in that provider's suite. Adding a new provider should require zero changes to existing shared files. Before you touch a shared file for one provider, read [Provider Isolation — Hard Rules](.agents/docs/agent-adapters.md#provider-isolation--hard-rules).
- Windows projects use native Windows cwd. WSL agent commands run through `wsl.exe -d <distro> --cd <linuxPath> --exec <agent command>`.
- **Version every compatibility boundary intentionally.** Before finishing a change to persisted state, a cache or derived index, a serialized manifest, a wire/IPC protocol, or a deployed helper/plugin, audit the version at that boundary and every mirrored copy. If an older app artifact can remain present but is no longer valid, add a migration or invalidate it with a version bump and a pre-upgrade regression test. See [Versioned State & Protocols](.agents/docs/versioning.md) for the required checklist and repository inventory.

## Working Rules

- For UI changes, follow existing app patterns first. Prefer shared variants and local component conventions over raw library defaults or new visual treatments.
- For absolutely positioned HeroUI tooltips, put positioning on an out-of-flow wrapper and keep `Tooltip.Trigger` normally positioned inside it. `Tooltip.Trigger` renders an `inline-block`; wrapping an absolute child directly can add layout space and anchor the tooltip to the wrong box.
- Keep visual scope tight. Do not add layout stabilizers, decorative styling, or state treatments unless they are part of the request.
- For runtime/chat bugs, trace the real state path before changing the display layer. Timer, notification, resume, and launch symptoms usually come from thread runtime state.
- For performance complaints, investigate render invalidation, measurement loops, and sync I/O before applying cosmetic workarounds.
- For provider work, normalize provider-native payloads at the provider boundary. Shared UI/runtime code should consume provider-agnostic shapes only. If the fix seems to require editing a shared file, first look for an existing extension point there — most shared modules already expose one, and adding a second special case is how the boundary rots.
- When changing Codex/OpenCode behavior, verify current provider payloads or protocol behavior and check cross-provider parity when applicable.
- For focused fixes, prefer nearby tests plus touched-file lint/format checks. If asked to fix all checks, run and make green: `pnpm run typecheck`, `pnpm run lint`, and `pnpm run test`.
- **Prevent God Files:** Do not allow files to grow indefinitely. If a file becomes complex or violates single-responsibility principles during your work, refactor it by extracting related logic into new modules or sub-components. Splitting files is preferred over extending existing ones.
- Use `pnpm exec vitest run ...` for targeted Vitest runs; do not use Jest-only flags like `--runInBand`.
- With `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`, avoid passing explicit `undefined` for optional props; use conditional spreads when needed.
- Put investigation dumps, screenshots, and other temporary files under `tmp/` or `.tmp/` (both gitignored). Never write scratch artifacts into the repo root or tracked paths like `verification-shots/`.

## Internationalization (i18n)

Any user-facing string in `src/renderer` (menus, buttons, dialogs, labels, placeholders, tooltips, toasts, `aria-label`) must be localized in the same change. Lingui (`@lingui/*` v6) scans **only `src/renderer`**. Source locale is `en`; fill all **12 non-English catalogs** (`es`, `ru`, `uk`, `zh-CN`, `ja`, `pt-BR`, `de`, `fr`, `ko`, `pl`, `vi`, `tr`) at `src/renderer/locales/{locale}/messages.po`. Macros, examples, terminology, and "add a language" steps: [Internationalization (i18n)](.agents/docs/i18n.md).

1. Wrap with the right macro: JSX body → `<Trans>`; attributes/strings in a component → `` t`…` `` from `useLingui()`; module-level labels → `msg`; toasts/actions → `i18n._(msg`…`)`; supervisor/main → key in `src/shared/messages.ts` plus descriptor in `src/renderer/i18n/sharedMessages.ts`.
2. Run `pnpm i18n:extract` (skipping this leaves the UI in English with no error).
3. Fill every new `msgstr ""` in all 12 non-English catalogs — they are fully translated, not English-fallback. Keep `Poracode`, `WSL`, `.poracode/worktrees` literal; grep an existing catalog entry for terminology.
4. Re-run `pnpm i18n:extract` and confirm **0 missing** for every locale.

Before finishing: no raw user-facing literals in `src/renderer`; extract stats 0 missing; all 12 `msgstr` filled; typecheck and lint pass on touched files.
